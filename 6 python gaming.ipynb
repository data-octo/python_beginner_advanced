Pygame is one of the best libraries to create mainly 2D retro arcade games such as Tetris, PacMan or Space Invaders.\n\nLet’s see what are the first few steps needed to create your first game in Python.\n\n### Installing Pygame\n\nMake sure you have access to the Pygame library. If not you will need to download and install it following the instructions provided on the Pygame website: http://www.pygame.org/.\n\n\nStep 1: Importing and initialising the Pygame library\n\nYour Python code will need to start with the following two lines of code:\n```\n# Import the pygame library and initialise the game engine\nimport pygame\npygame.init()\n```\n\nStep 2: Define the colours you will use in your game\n\nYou will have to declare a constant for each of the main colours used within your game. To help you identify colour codes you may use a colour picker.\n```\n# Define some colors\nBLACK = ( 0, 0, 0)\nWHITE = ( 255, 255, 255)\nGREEN = ( 0, 255, 0)\nRED = ( 255, 0, 0)\n```\n\nStep 3: Open a new window\n\nYour game will run in its own window, for which you can decide of a title, a width and a height.\n```\n# Open a new window\nsize = (700, 500)\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode(size)\npygame.display.set_caption(\"My First Game\")\n```\n\nStep 4: The main program loop\n\nThe main program loop is the key wrapper for your game.\n\nThe main program loop will contain 3 main sections:\n\n- Capturing Events: Used to constantly “listen” to user inputs and react to these. It could be when the user use the keyboard or the mouse.\n- Implementing the Game Logic. What happens when the game is running? Are cars moving forward, aliens falling from the sky, ghosts chasing you, etc.\n- Refreshing the screen by redrawing the stage and the sprites.\n\nThe main program loop will also use a frame rate to decide how often should the program complete the loop (& refresh the screen) per second. To implement this we will use the clock object from the pygame library.\n\nThe main program loop will use a timer to decide how many times it will be executed per second.\n\n```\n# The loop will carry on until the user exit the game (e.g. clicks the close button).\ncarryOn = True\n \n# The clock will be used to control how fast the screen updates\nclock = pygame.time.Clock()\n \n# -------- Main Program Loop -----------\nwhile carryOn:\n    # --- Main event loop\n    for event in pygame.event.get(): # User did something\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: # If user clicked close\n              carryOn = False # Flag that we are done so we exit this loop\n \n     # --- Game logic should go here\n \n     # --- Drawing code should go here\n     # First, clear the screen to white. \n     screen.fill(WHITE)\n     #The you can draw different shapes and lines or add text to your background stage.\n     pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, [55, 200, 100, 70],0)\n     pygame.draw.line(screen, GREEN, [0, 0], [100, 100], 5)\n     pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, BLACK, [20,20,250,100], 2)\n \n \n     # --- Go ahead and update the screen with what we've drawn.\n     pygame.display.flip()\n     \n     # --- Limit to 60 frames per second\n     clock.tick(60)\n \n#Once we have exited the main program loop we can stop the game engine:\npygame.quit()\n```"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import pygame\npygame.init()\n\nwin = pygame.display.set_mode((500,500))\npygame.display.set_caption(\"First Game\")\n\nx = 50\ny = 50\nwidth = 40\nheight = 60\nvel = 5\n\nrun = True\n\nwhile run:\n    pygame.time.delay(100)\n\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            run = False\n\n    pygame.draw.rect(win, (255,0,0), (x, y, width, height))  #This takes: window/surface, color, rect \n    pygame.display.update() # This updates the screen so we can see our rectangle\n    \npygame.quit()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"### Flappy Bird\n\nhttps://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird.git\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"### Gomoku\n\nhttps://github.com/positive235/gomoku"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
