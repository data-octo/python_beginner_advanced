In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.\n\nPython has five standard data types âˆ’\n\n- Numbers\n- String\n- List\n- Tuple\n- Dictionary\n\n##### Numbers\n\nPython supports two types of numbers - integers and floating point numbers. (It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial).\n\n##### Strings\nStrings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.\n\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"one = 1\ntwo = 2\nthree = one + two\nprint(three)\n\nhello = \"hello\"\nworld = \"world\"\nhelloworld = hello + \" \" + world\nprint(helloworld)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"### Conditions and Loops\n\nPython uses boolean variables to evaluate conditions. The boolean values True and False are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated.\n\nThere are two types of loops in Python, for and while.
