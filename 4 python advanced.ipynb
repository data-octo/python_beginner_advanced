The import has the following syntax −\n\n`import module1[, module2[,... moduleN]`\n\n\n### The from...import Statement\n\nPython's from statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace. The from...import has the following syntax −\n\n`from modname import name1[, name2[, ... nameN]]`\n\nFor example, to import the function fibonacci from the module fib, use the following statement −\n\n`from fib import fibonacci`\n\nThis statement does not import the entire module fib into the current namespace; it just introduces the item fibonacci from the module fib into the global symbol table of the importing module.\n\n### The from...import * Statement\n\nIt is also possible to import all names from a module into the current namespace by using the following import statement −\n\n`from modname import *`\n\nThis provides an easy way to import all the items from a module into the current namespace; however, this statement should be used sparingly."},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"## Practice\n\n1.
