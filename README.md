## Audience

- Beginners (any age with some computer knowledge) of Programming
- Kids (10 - 15 years old) interested in Coding
- Programmers interested in Data Science (Analytics and Visualization)
- Programmers interested in AI (Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning) 

## Prerequisites

It'll be good if you have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus. However, this course is also designed for you if you don't have any computer or programming experience.

## Easter Egg

Try following in Python command line:

`>>> import this`

## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
