Fun is a great motivator, and since you'll be able to build prototypes and tools quickly with Python, many find coding in Python a satisfying experience. Thus, Python has gained popularity for being a beginner-friendly language, and it has replaced Java as the most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities.\n\n## Easy to Understand\n\nBeing a very high level language, Python reads like English, which takes a lot of syntax-learning stress off coding beginners. Python handles a lot of complexity for you, so it is very beginner-friendly in that it allows beginners to focus on learning programming concepts and not have to worry about too much details.\n\n## Very Flexible\n\nAs a dynamically typed language, Python is really flexible. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods (though the Python philosophy encourages using the obvious way to solve things). Furthermore, Python is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.\n\n## Beginner Friendly\n\nThere are dozens of programming languages, and many of them are good for a wide variety of projects. But Python is unique in that it’s easy to understand, even for a beginner. Some languages use a perplexing combination of symbols and abbreviations. Python doesn’t.\n\n## Kids Won’t Outgrow Python\n\nA few programming languages designed for beginners are purely graphical. These are called “block” languages. Scratch is an example of a block programming language. Although Scratch is good for really young learners, it’s easy to outgrow.\n\nThat’s not the case with Python, which powers the world’s second-largest search engine: YouTube. Scientists use Python to work with large data sets, and software engineers build neural networks and other forms of artificial intelligence with this versatile language.\n\n## Top 7 uses\n\n1.
